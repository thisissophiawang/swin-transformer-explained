## üìö About The Project

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of the Swin Transformer architecture, developed as part of a Deep Learning course project. Our goal is to help others understand this powerful architecture through detailed explanations, visualizations, and practical implementations.

### What is Swin Transformer?

Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that uses shifted windows for efficient modeling of visual data. It addresses key limitations of previous vision transformers by:
- Computing self-attention within local windows
- Supporting hierarchical feature maps
- Achieving linear computational complexity relative to image size
